# ResBaz governance and operations manual

## Bylaws

### Purpose

#### Mission

ResBaz Arizona focuses on three core areas: campaign, community, and conference. We empower members towards open, reproducible research through peer-to-peer interactions. In addressing the need to train researchers in emerging interdisciplinary domains, ResBaz Arizona fosters community to engage researchers, point them to relevant resources, and break down departmental work silos. ResBaz events (i.e. Hacky Hour, Coffee & Code, annual conference) aim to equip researchers with digital skills, promote interdisciplinary collaboration, and strengthen the research community at the University of Arizona and beyond.

Please read more about our core mission [on our website](https://github.com/resbazaz/core_mission).

ResBaz is committed to the following values:

-   **Data science campaign**: We believe that research should be open and accessible to everyone.
