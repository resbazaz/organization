# ResBaz governance and operations manual

## Bylaws

### Purpose

#### Mission

ResBaz Arizona focuses on three core areas: campaign, community, and conference. We empower members towards open, reproducible research through peer-to-peer interactions. In addressing the need to train researchers in emerging interdisciplinary domains, ResBaz Arizona fosters community to engage researchers, point them to relevant resources, and break down departmental work silos. ResBaz events (i.e. Hacky Hour, Coffee & Code, annual conference) aim to equip researchers with digital skills, promote interdisciplinary collaboration, and strengthen the research community at the University of Arizona and beyond.

Please read more about our core mission [on our website](https://github.com/resbazaz/core_mission).

#### Values

ResBaz is committed to the following values:

-   **Open (data) science**: We believe that research should be open and accessible to everyone.

-   **Collaboration**: We believe that the best research is done through collaboration.

-   **Diversity & Equity**: We believe that a diverse and inclusive community is essential for innovation.

### Community Programs

ResBaz offers a variety of community-oriented events, including, but not limited to weekly meetups (Coffee & Code, Hacky Hour), and an annual conference. In addition, ResBaz maintains a slack channel, which allows participants to share data-science related information such as job opportunities, memes, event information, and others. Further, ResBaz maintains a website that is used to share information about ResBaz's community programs.

#### Annual Conference

ResBaz AZ promotes digital literacy at the center of modern research. Our annual festival is a dynamic and interactive event that brings together researchers, educators, industry professionals, and enthusiasts. The ResBaz AZ annual festival serves as a platform for showcasing the individuals who work with data. Through its inclusive and forward-thinking environment, the festival inspires and empowers individuals to embrace community, digital tools, and teaching, ultimately shaping a more digitally fluent society.

#### Coffee & Code

At Coffee & Code, researchers come together to debug code, exchange programming ideas, foster a supportive community, and enjoy caffeine. Coffee & Code operates on the principles of inclusivity, collaboration, and knowledge sharing. We strive to create an environment where every individual feels valued, empowered, and inspired to engage in meaningful exchanges, resulting in a vibrant community that fosters innovation and elevates programming practices in research.

Coffee & Code is intended to be a conversational group - not a help desk. We do not provide services or guarantee solutions, but we might be able to help those seeking advice. When troubleshooting inquiries arise, it is up to each individual participant to choose to volunteer their time. Familiarity with other data science resources online or on campus is encouraged, but not required.

-   Coffee & Code will be held at a venue that works for most members of the #coffee-and-code slack channel
-   Coffee & Code will be held in the mornings, at a time that works for most members of the #coffee-and-code slack channel

#### Hacky Hour

Hacky Hour offers a space for networking with data science professionals and researchers. Patrons engage in meaningful discussions, seek help, and learn from each other's data-related expertises. We encourage respectful and collaborative interaction among participants.

Hacky Hour is intended as a support group - not a help desk. When troubleshooting inquiries inevitability arise, it is up to each individual to choose to volunteer their time. We encourage our community members to be familiar with other data science resources online or on campus, just in case.

-   Hacky Hour will be held at a venue that works for most members of the #hacky-hour slack channel
-   Hacky Hour will be held preferably during the hours 4-7pm

### Membership

ResBaz is a grassroots community of members based in Tucson, Arizona, USA. Membership in ResBaz is self-appointed.

#### Communication

ResBaz communicates with the community through a variety of channels, including its [website](https://researchbazaar.arizona.edu/), slack, [gittr](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#resbaz_Arizona:gitter.im), [social media](https://twitter.com/resbazaz), and with contributions directly to the [ResBaz GitHub](https://github.com/resbazaz).

#### Voting membership

ResBaz strives to make decisions through community involvement with slack messages. By default, changes are approved when no one voices concerns within a period of time, following [lazy consensus](https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html).

### Leadership

ResBaz and its events are typically not led, but organized by a small group of self-selected volunteers.

### Funding

ResBaz is primarily based on volunteers donating time to ResBaz. Some events are occasionally funded by a variety of sources, including individual donations, university sponsorships, and grants. Each committee is responsible for ensuring their respective events are funded. The executive committee oversees the responsible management of ResBaz's gross finances in a transparent manner.

### Code of conduct

ResBaz is a community intended for networking and collaboration as well as learning. We value the participation of every member of the data science community. We strive for all attendees at our events to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly all attendees at our events (as well as participants in online interactions associated with ResBaz) are expected to show respect and courtesy to each other.


-   ResBaz is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or choice of text editor. **We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.**

-   Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately

-   Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate

-   Be kind to others

-   Do not insult or put down other attendees

-   Make ResBaz events welcoming and friendly for all

**To report a breach of the code of conduct, please email us at ResBazAZ[at]gmail.com**

Violation of the code of conduct will be handeled with the sole discretion of the event committee. If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund of any fee that may have been levied.


### Conflict resolution

The conflict resolution policy for the ResBaz community promotes open communication and collaboration, encouraging members to address conflicts respectfully and seek resolution through mediation or arbitration if necessary, with the ultimate goal of maintaining a harmonious community environment.


### Intellectual property

All intellectual property created by ResBaz is owned by the community. All intellectual property developed by instructors of the annual festival is not part of the intellectual property of ResBaz, but should be shared with an open access license. The executive committee is responsible for managing the community's intellectual property in a responsible and transparent manner.

### Termination

ResBaz may be terminated by a unanimous vote of the executive committee. In the event of termination, the executive committee will be responsible for ensuring that the community's assets are transferred to a new organization that is committed to the mission of ResBaz.

### Amendments

The amendment process to this governance allows for updates to the governing policies, procedures, and structures. Proposed amendments can be submitted by community members, are reviewed by a designated ad-hoc committee, and will require a majority vote by the delegaated committee for approval, ensuring a dynamic and responsive governance framework.

Amendments to this governance should be submitted via the GitHub issues of the proper repository. Amendments are accepted with majority consent of the committee (executive or ad-hoc, as delegated).

## Committees

ResBaz committees operate as dedicated teams, working together to steer ResBaz affiliated events towards the defined objectives. Each committee acts as a catalyst for driving change and advancing digital literacy within the respective event.

ResBaz committees are either standing or ad-hoc. Ad-hoc committees are charged by the community for short-term projects and events.

### Formation of ad-hoc committees

The formation process may involve open calls for volunteers and nominations by the executive committee. Interested members of ResBaz with willingness to contribute will be accepted on ad-hoc committees. Contact ResBaz committees by email with the following structure: **ResBazAZ+CommiteeName[at]gmail.com**. The executive committee can be reached at **ResBazAZ[at]gmail.com**

### Operations

ResBaz committees will operate independently as best serves the group. A GitHub project is created for each committee to serve as a resource for transparent project management.

### Termination

A committee may be terminated by a unanimous vote from the executive committee. Members of a committee should contribute and participate regularly in their respective event. Committee members who have not been active in the past 12 months will be asked if they want to become emeritus members and recant their commit and voting rights until they become active again. The list of committee members, active and emeritus (with dates at which they became active) is public on the ResBaz website.

The executive committee can be terminated by unanimous vote of all non-executive committee members, standing and ad-hoc.

### Current standing committees

#### Executive committee

The executive committee, made up of current members of all other standing committees, organizes the ResBaz community and guides strategic planning. Thus, the executive committee is sensitive to the needs and wishes of each standing committee, while also containing non-partisan ResBaz community members from other event committees.

See ResBaz Leadership below for more detail on tasks overseen by the executive committee.

#### Conference committee

The conference committee is responsible for planning the conference, focusing on the ResBaz mission within planning conversations.

## ResBaz Leadership

### Roles and responsibilities

The following responsibilities and tasks shall be organized by executive committee members (technical governance is expected to be performed by the committee members of the various events and projects):

Social

-   Define, evolve, and defend the vision, mission and the values of ResBaz community through clear central governance

-   Coordinate the usage of the ResBaz brand

-   Act as a central point of contact for ResBaz

### Meetings

### Eligibility and composition

All current members of ResBaz committees are eligible for the executive committee. A minimum of one and up to two members of each (standing or ad-hoc) ResBaz committee may join the executive committee for any length of time, given they are still a member of the respective event committee. For example, given three standing ResBaz committes, an executive committee of three to six members is needed.

Volunteers with appreciable time to participate will be included in the executive committee, rather, individual committees may form processes for electing executive committee members.

### Limitations on Organizational Representation

No more than 70% of seats on the executive committee may be held by employees of the same organization (or conglomerate, in the case of companies owning each other). If it is impossible to find sufficient members to resign, all employees of that organization will be removed and new committees will be formed through random selection of active event participants.
