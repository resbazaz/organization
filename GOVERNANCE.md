# ResBaz governance and operations manual

## Bylaws

### Purpose

#### Mission

ResBaz Arizona focuses on three core areas: campaign, community, and conference. We empower members towards open, reproducible research through peer-to-peer interactions. In addressing the need to train researchers in emerging interdisciplinary domains, ResBaz Arizona fosters community to engage researchers, point them to relevant resources, and break down departmental work silos. ResBaz events (i.e. Hacky Hour, Coffee & Code, annual conference) aim to equip researchers with digital skills, promote interdisciplinary collaboration, and strengthen the research community at the University of Arizona and beyond.

Please read more about our core mission [on our website](https://github.com/resbazaz/core_mission).

#### Values

ResBaz is committed to the following values:

-   **Open (data) science**: We believe that research should be open and accessible to everyone.

-   **Collaboration**: We believe that the best research is done through collaboration.

-   **Diversity & Equity**: We believe that a diverse and inclusive community is essential for innovation.

### Community Programs

ResBaz offers a variety of community-oriented events, including, but not limited to weekly meetups (Coffee & Code, Hacky Hour), and an annual conference. In addition, ResBaz maintains a slack channel, which allows participants to share data-science related information such as job opportunities, memes, event information, and others. Further, ResBaz maintains a website that is used to share information about ResBaz's community programs.

#### Annual Conference

ResBaz AZ promotes digital literacy at the center of modern research. Our annual festival is a dynamic and interactive event that brings together researchers, educators, industry professionals, and enthusiasts. The ResBaz AZ annual festival serves as a platform for showcasing the individuals who work with data. Through its inclusive and forward-thinking environment, the festival inspires and empowers individuals to embrace community, digital tools, and teaching, ultimately shaping a more digitally fluent society.

#### Coffee & Code

At Coffee & Code, researchers come together to debug code, exchange programming ideas, foster a supportive community, and enjoy caffeine. Coffee & Code operates on the principles of inclusivity, collaboration, and knowledge sharing. We strive to create an environment where every individual feels valued, empowered, and inspired to engage in meaningful exchanges, resulting in a vibrant community that fosters innovation and elevates programming practices in research.

Coffee & Code is intended to be a conversational group over a help desk. We do not provide services or guarantee solutions, but we might be able to help those seeking advice. When troubleshooting inquiries arise, it is up to each individual participant to choose to volunteer their time. Familiarity with other data science resources online or on campus is encouraged, but not required.

-   Coffee & Code will be held at a venue that works for most members of the #coffee-and-code slack channel
-   Coffee & Code will be held in the mornings, at a time that works for most members of the #coffee-and-code slack channel

#### Hacky Hour

Hacky Hour offers a space for networking with data science professionals and researchers. Patrons engage in meaningful discussions, seek help, and learn from each other's data-related expertises. We encourage respectful and collaborative interaction among participants.

Hacky Hour is intended as a support group over a help desk. When troubleshooting inquiries inevitability arise, it is up to each individual to choose to volunteer their time. We encourage our community members to be familiar with other data science resources online or on campus, just in case.
