# ResBaz governance and operations manual

## Bylaws

### Purpose

#### Mission

ResBaz Arizona focuses on three core areas: campaign, community, and conference. We empower members towards open, reproducible research through peer-to-peer interactions. In addressing the need to train researchers in emerging interdisciplinary domains, ResBaz Arizona fosters community to engage researchers, point them to relevant resources, and break down departmental work silos. ResBaz events (i.e. Hacky Hour, Coffee & Code, annual conference) aim to equip researchers with digital skills, promote interdisciplinary collaboration, and strengthen the research community at the University of Arizona and beyond.

Please read more about our core mission [on our website](https://github.com/resbazaz/core_mission).

#### Values

ResBaz is committed to the following values:

-   **Open (data) science**: We believe that research should be open and accessible to everyone.

-   **Collaboration**: We believe that the best research is done through collaboration.

-   **Diversity & Equity**: We believe that a diverse and inclusive community is essential for innovation.

### Community Programs

ResBaz offers a variety of community-oriented events, including, but not limited to weekly meetups (Coffee & Code, Hacky Hour), and an annual conference. In addition, ResBaz maintains a slack channel, which allows participants to share data-science related information such as job opportunities, memes, event information, and others. Further, ResBaz maintains a website that is used to share information about ResBaz's community programs.

#### Annual Conference

ResBaz AZ promotes digital literacy at the center of modern research. Our annual festival is a dynamic and interactive event that brings together researchers, educators, industry professionals, and enthusiasts. The ResBaz AZ annual festival serves as a platform for showcasing the individuals who work with data. Through its inclusive and forward-thinking environment, the festival inspires and empowers individuals to embrace community, digital tools, and teaching, ultimately shaping a more digitally fluent society.

#### Coffee & Code

At Coffee & Code, researchers come together to debug code, exchange programming ideas, foster a supportive community, and enjoy caffeine. Coffee & Code operates on the principles of inclusivity, collaboration, and knowledge sharing. We strive to create an environment where every individual feels valued, empowered, and inspired to engage in meaningful exchanges, resulting in a vibrant community that fosters innovation and elevates programming practices in research.

Coffee & Code is intended to be a conversational group over a help desk. We do not provide services or guarantee solutions, but we might be able to help those seeking advice. When troubleshooting inquiries arise, it is up to each individual participant to choose to volunteer their time. Familiarity with other data science resources online or on campus is encouraged, but not required.

-   Coffee & Code will be held at a venue that works for most members of the #coffee-and-code slack channel
-   Coffee & Code will be held in the mornings, at a time that works for most members of the #coffee-and-code slack channel

#### Hacky Hour

Hacky Hour offers a space for networking with data science professionals and researchers. Patrons engage in meaningful discussions, seek help, and learn from each other's data-related expertises. We encourage respectful and collaborative interaction among participants.

Hacky Hour is intended as a support group over a help desk. When troubleshooting inquiries inevitability arise, it is up to each individual to choose to volunteer their time. We encourage our community members to be familiar with other data science resources online or on campus, just in case.

-   Hacky Hour will be held at a venue that works for most members of the #hacky-hour slack channel
-   Hacky Hour will be held preferably during the hours 4-7pm

### Membership

ResBaz is a grassroots community of members based in Tucson, Arizona, USA. Membership in ResBaz is self-appointed.

#### Communication

ResBaz communicates with the community through a variety of channels, including its [website](https://researchbazaar.arizona.edu/), slack, [gittr](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#resbaz_Arizona:gitter.im), [social media](https://twitter.com/resbazaz), and with contributions directly to the [ResBaz GitHub](https://github.com/resbazaz).

#### Voting membership

ResBaz strives to make decisions through community involvement with slack messages. By default, changes are approved when no one voices concerns within a period of time, following lazy consensus.

Anyone who has at least [TODO:Number] contributions in the last 12 months is eligible to vote in the executive committee elections. Contributions are defined on GitHub as opening PRs, reviewing and commenting on PRs, and opening and commenting on issues. Other contributions may also look like helping people on community forums, participating in committees, and other efforts that help advance the ResBaz mission.

### Leadership

ResBaz and its events are typically not led, but organized by a small group of self-selected volunteers.

### Funding

ResBaz is primarily based on volunteers donating time to ResBaz. Some events are occasionally funded by a variety of sources, including individual donations, university sponsorships, and grants. The steering committee is responsible for ensuring that ResBaz's finances are managed in a responsible and transparent manner.

### Code of conduct

ResBaz is a community intended for networking and collaboration as well as learning. We value the participation of every member of the scientific community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the event and in interactions online associated with ResBaz.

### Intellectual property

All intellectual property created by ResBaz is owned by the community. All intellectual property developed by instructors of the annual festival is not part of the intellectual property of ResBaz, but should be shared with an open access license. The steering committee is responsible for managing the community's intellectual property in a responsible and transparent manner.

### Termination

ResBaz may be terminated by a unanimous vote of the steering committee. In the event of termination, the steering committee will be responsible for ensuring that the community's assets are transferred to a new organization that is committed to the mission of ResBaz.

### Amendments

The amendment process to this governance allows for updates to the governing policies, procedures, and structures. Proposed amendments can be submitted by community members, reviewed by a designated ad-hoc committee, and require a majority vote for approval, ensuring a dynamic and responsive governance framework.

Amendments to this governance should be submitted via the GitHub issues of the proper repository. Amendments are accepted with majority consent of the committee (executive or ad-hoc, as delegated).

## Committees

ResBaz committees operate as dedicated teams, working together to steer ResBaz affiliated events towards the defined objectives. Each committee acts as a catalyst for driving change and advancing digital literacy within the respective event.

ResBaz committees are either standing or ad-hoc. Ad-hoc committees are charged by the executive committee, which is a standing committee, for short-term projects and events.

### Formation of ad-hoc committees

The formation process may involve open calls for volunteers and nominations by the executive committee. Interested members of ResBaz with willingness to contribute will be accepted on ad-hoc committees.

### Operations

ResBaz committees will operate independently as best serves the group. A GitHub project is created for each committee to serve as a resource for transparent project management.

### Termination

A committee may be terminated by a unanimous vote from the executive committee. Members of a committee should contribute and participate regularly in their respective event.

The executive committee can be terminated by [help].

## ResBaz Leadership

### Roles and responsibilities

The following responsibilities and powers belong to the executive committee (technical governance is expected to be performed by the committee members of the various events and projects):

-   Delegate ownership of, responsibility for and authority over ResBaz community events and projects to specific committees.

-   Define, evolve, and defend the vision, mission and the values of ResBaz community.

-   Define and evolve governance structures and policies.

-   Act as a final escalation point for disputes in any committee.

### Meetings

### Eligibility and composition

All voting members of ResBaz are eligible for the executive committee.

### Limitations on Company Representation

No more than [TODO: Number] executive committee seats may be held by employees of the same organization (or conglomerate, in the case of companies owning each other).

If an election results in greater than [TODO: Number] employees of the same organization being selected, the lowest vote getters from any particular employer will be removed until representation on the executive committee is down to [TODO: Number].

If employers change because of job changes, acquisitions, or other events, in a way that would yield too many seats being held by employees of the same organization, sufficient members of the executive committee must resign until only [TODO: Number] employees of the same employer are left. If it is impossible to find sufficient members to resign, all employees of that organization will be removed and new special elections held.
