# ResBaz governance and operations manual

## Bylaws

### Purpose

#### Mission

ResBaz Arizona focuses on three core areas: campaign, community, and conference. We empower members towards open, reproducible research through peer-to-peer interactions. In addressing the need to train researchers in emerging interdisciplinary domains, ResBaz Arizona fosters community to engage researchers, point them to relevant resources, and break down departmental work silos. ResBaz events (i.e. Hacky Hour, Coffee & Code, annual conference) aim to equip researchers with digital skills, promote interdisciplinary collaboration, and strengthen the research community at the University of Arizona and beyond.

Please read more about our core mission [on our website](https://github.com/resbazaz/core_mission).

#### Values

ResBaz is committed to the following values:

-   **Data science campaign**: We believe that research should be open and accessible to everyone.

-   **Collaborative conference**: We believe that the best research is done through collaboration.

-   **Diverse and inclusive community**: We believe that a diverse and inclusive community is essential for innovation.

### Community Programs

#### Annual Conference

ResBaz AZ promotes digital literacy at the center of modern research. Our annual festival is a dynamic and interactive event that brings together researchers, educators, industry professionals, and enthusiasts. The ResBaz AZ annual festival serves as a platform for showcasing the individuals who work with data. Through its inclusive and forward-thinking environment, the festival inspires and empowers individuals to embrace community, digital tools, and teaching, ultimately shaping a more digitally fluent society.

#### Coffee & Code

At Coffee & Code, researchers come together to debug code, exchange programming ideas, foster a supportive community, and enjoy caffeiene. Coffee & Code operates on the principles of inclusivity, collaboration, and knowledge sharing, ensuring an exceptional experience for all participants. We strive to create an environment where every individual feels valued, empowered, and inspired to actively engage, resulting in a vibrant community that fosters innovation and elevates programming practices in research.

Coffee & Code aims to position itself as a conversational group over a help desk. When troubleshooting inquiries inevitability arise, it is up to each individual to choose to volunteer their time. We encourage our community members to be familiar with other data science resources online or on campus, just in case.

-   Coffee & Code will be held preferably in the mornings, at a time that works for most members of the #coffee-and-code slack channel

#### Hacky Hour

Hacky Hour offers a space for networking with data science professionals and researchers. Patrons engage in meaningful discussions, seek help, and learn from each other's data-related expertises. We encourage respectful and collaborative interaction among participants.
