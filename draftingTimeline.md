        - "how do we want to vote?"
        - "what threshold do we require to proceed?"
        - revisions to this timeline
    ...by creating a `/vote` on a:
        - Github issue, and/or
        - ideally, a Github pull request that:
            - edits the timeline document
            - edits `.gitvote.yml` with an updated voting policy
